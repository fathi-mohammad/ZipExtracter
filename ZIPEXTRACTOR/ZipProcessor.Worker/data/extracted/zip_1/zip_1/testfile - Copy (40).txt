Congress vs RJD vs CPI vs VIP: Mahagathbandhan’s ‘friendly fights’ problem in Bihar
In an election of fine margins — the difference between the NDA and the Opposition coalition was 0.03% vote share and 15 seats in 2020 — these 11 contests could be a decisive factor.

Asked about the nine seats where both the Congress and the RJD are contesting, state Congress spokesperson Gyan Ranjan claimed it was a “strategic move” on the Opposition alliance’s part. But, a senior party leader said the fight in these seats would be quite “unfriendly” contests.

Despite several rounds of negotiations between the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Opposition Mahagatbandhan parties were unable to prevent “friendly fights” in 11 seats in Bihar. The Congress is in the contest in nine such seats, facing off against the Tejashwi Prasad Yadav-led RJD in five seats and against the CPI in four. The RJD and Mukesh Sahani’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) are facing off in two constituencies.

While seven of these constituencies are currently held by NDA parties, one was won by a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate who later switched to the JD(U), and the rest are with the Opposition. In an election of fine margins — the difference between the two coalitions was 0.03% vote share and 15 seats in 2020 — “friendly fights” in 11 seats could be a decisive factor.
